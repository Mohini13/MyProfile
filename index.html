<p><b> right now I am in canada and I am student here actually I am from India and I come here in the month of september for the study and I am studying computer programming in the humber college.Here I am staying with my brother .Actually I want share some interesting things with you in these pictures I was kid and I was really naughty and I think I will remain naughty for my whole life. I have a big joint family in India
we are ten member in a family and we live along with my uncle's family and it is true that we we are ten people and we all live under the one roof and we enjoy alot but here in this country we are only two person and it is very boaring because I am habitaul of staying with big family and sometime when my brother is on his job I become very boar.So I am missing my family and country.<b><p>

<p> I did my schooling from my country and in my high school I had the accounting and business but after the completion of my school when I had to go in college I dicided to come here and study computer programming I change my field not because I have the special interest in IT but my family suggested me to chose the IT because in theses days IT is very demanding and moreover, now I find my course is very interesting and scope of programming is very good.So basically now I want to become a computer programmer but sometime its become very difficult for me to understand the programming concept as it is new for me but I am trying my best now</p>
<p>In these picture in the middle one I was sitting with my parents and I have two siblings both of them are student. I have two best friends and both of them are in India. One of them is my chidhood friend and her name is Devika and other is Pooja, I met her when I was in 12th class and we both had the accountancy tuition classes in the evening time and from friends we both become the best friends apart from this I like to play basketball and in the free time I like to dance.I can't stay quiet for the long time and you know I don't like shopping it is the wrost thing I don't like to do and I always wear those clothes which my mom select for me but the bad thing is that here I have to do that.So this what I am.</p>
